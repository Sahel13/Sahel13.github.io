# Sahel13.github.io

Source code for my personal website. The website is generated using
[Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/index.html), a static site generator
written in Haskell. The design is heavily inspired from

- Ayush Singh's [personal website](https://github.com/11DE784A/11DE784A.github.io).
- [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).

A great reference for what is possible with Hakyll (and what I would like to _slowly_ build towards) is [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net/).
