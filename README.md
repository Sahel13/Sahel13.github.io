# Sahel13.github.io

Source code for my personal website. The website is generated using
[Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/index.html), a static site generator
written in Haskell. The design and features of the website are heavily inspired
by the following sources:

- [Tony Zorman's blog](https://tony-zorman.com/).
- [Ayush Singh's blog](https://github.com/11DE784A/11DE784A.github.io).
- [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
- [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net/).

## Features

- [KaTex](https://katex.org/) for rendering math equations. The implementation is taken from [Tony Zorman's blog post](https://tony-zorman.com/posts/katex-with-hakyll.html) on the subject. It uses [deno](https://deno.com/) to run KaTex.
