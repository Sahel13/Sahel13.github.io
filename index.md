  <h1>Sahel Iqbal</h1>
</div>

I'm Sahel Iqbal, a third-year PhD student at Aalto University, Finland, where I
work with [Simo Särkkä](https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/). My main
research focus is on developing accurate and efficient Monte Carlo algorithms
for reinforcement learning and Bayesian experimental design (BED). Recently, I
have also developed an interest in how similar algorithms can be used for
inference-time alignment of diffusion and large language models.

For academic details, see my [resume](/files/cv_sahel_iqbal.pdf) and my [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KP7mJUgAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.
I can be contacted on [X](https://x.com/sahel_iqbal) and at my email
sahel[dot]iqbal[at]aalto[dot]fi.

Outside work, my time is mostly taken up by reading, lifting weights, and
writing JAX code. The projects that I'm actively working on are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Sahel13).
