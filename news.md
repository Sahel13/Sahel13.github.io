- 2026-01: We released a new JAX library for inference in state-space models
  called `cuthbert`! Checkout the [tweet](https://x.com/sahel_iqbal/status/2017210852642803839?s=20) and the [code](https://github.com/state-space-models/cuthbert).
- 2025-09: Our paper [Sequential Monte Carlo for Policy Optimization in
  Continuous POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16732) has been accepted to
  NeurIPS 2025!
- 2025-07: If you're attending [MCM
  2025](https://ccbatiit.github.io/mcm2025/), my coauthor [Adrien
  Corenflos](https://adriencorenflos.github.io/) will be giving a talk on our
  joint work on BED.
- 2025-06: Gave a talk on using particle filters for amortized BED at the
  _[Accelerating statistical inference and experimental design with machine
  learning workshop](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/rclw03/)_ at the Isaac Newton
  Institute for Mathematical Sciences.
- 2024-12: Presented a poster at the [Bayesian Decision-making and
  Uncertainty workshop](https://gp-seminar-series.github.io/neurips-2024/) at
